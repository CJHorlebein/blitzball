            <p>Blitzball is a sport, played between two teams. The long history of the game can be traced back to 
                over 1000 years ago when teams would challenge each other in the great Arenas located in places 
                such as Zanarkand and Bevelle. The rules and traditions have changed little in the years since and 
                today, Blitzball is practiced across Spira.</p> 
            <p>Each team consist of 6 players in total with two players allowed to be kept in reserve as substitutes. 
                A typical team consists of two forwards, a mid-fielder, a goal keeper, and two defenders. A match typically 
                lasts two rounds of five minutes each where players attempt to shoot a ball, commonly called a blitzball, 
                into the opponentâ€™s goal.</p>
